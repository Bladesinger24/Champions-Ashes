******************
* ASHES LAUNCHER *
******************

Installing, updating, enabling, and disabling is all handled by the launcher now.


LEGACY_INSTALLATION
------------
Unzip the downloaded file, then place:
		
	_ashes (the whole folder) 
	dinput8.dll
	modengine.ini

in your root game directory. (where the darksoulsIII.exe is)


LEGACY_UNINSTALLATION
--------------
Rename the "dinput8.dll" file to something else, like "disable_dinput8.dll".
This will completely disable the mod and return your game to its vanilla state.


IMPORTANT NOTE
--------------
This mod WILL ban you if you have it enabled and launch the game. 
Make sure it's disabled before using a character that you don't want banned.
